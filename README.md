This project is part of the Object Oriented Programming Specialization (5 course series) on Coursera, taught by Dr. Matthew Yee-King.
This program was developed as I worked through the courses, but I have decided to take my own approach on certain aspects and ended up diverging from the course and completing the project on my own.

To build:
run the following command in terminal: g++ -o simulation main.cpp CSVReader.cpp MerkelMain.cpp OrderBook.cpp OrderBookEntry.cpp Wallet.cpp

To run:
run the following command in terminal: ./simulation

Your objective:
You start with 100,000 USDT coins. Your goal is to analyze the market and make money. The cryptocurrencies available for trade are USDT, ETH, BTC and DOGE.
